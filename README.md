# Running Man (v0.5.0)

As someone who's grown up playing games, I decided to challenge myself by creating a simple game in `PyGame`. During car rides while I was younger, I've often imagined a character running alongside our car and dodging obstacles. Although I'm not a graphics designer or game developer, I drew upon my knowledge of Python to bring my vision to life.

To create the game, I used a variety of free [resources](#resources) from talented content creators who generously shared their work.

> Work in progress. Happy to receive any feedback via [Issues](https://github.com/eeshawn11/Running_Man/issues)!

## How to Play

Dodge obstacles as you run along a path. See how far you can go and try to beat your high score!

- ![W](./assets/readme/computer_key_W_T.png) to jump
- ![A](./assets/readme/computer_key_A_T.png) and ![D](./assets/readme/computer_key_D_T.png) to move
- ![E](./assets/readme/computer_key_E_T.png) to pause the game or reset after you die
- ![Q](./assets/readme/computer_key_Q_T.png) to quickly exit the game (in case a co-worker walks past!)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

``` python
