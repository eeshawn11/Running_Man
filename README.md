# Running Man (v0.4.1)

Remember those long car rides where you imagined a character running alongside the vehicle? I've recreated that experience in `PyGame`! Dodge cars and jump over obstacles as you run along a picturesque lake. See how far you can go and try to beat your high score.

> Still a work in progress. Happy to receive any feedback via [Issues](https://github.com/eeshawn11/Running_Man/issues).

## How to Play

Move and jump to dodge cars as you run along this idyllic lake.

- ![A](./assets/readme/computer_key_A_T.png) and ![D](./assets/readme/computer_key_D_T.png) to move
- ![E](./assets/readme/computer_key_E_T.png) to pause the game
- ![Q](./assets/readme/computer_key_Q_T.png) to quickly exit the game (in case a co-worker walks past)

## Installation
