# Running Man

Remember those long car rides where you imagined a character running alongside the vehicle? I've recreated that experience in `PyGame`! Dodge cars and jump over obstacles as you run along a picturesque lake. See how far you can go and try to beat your high score.

> Still a work in progress. Happy to receive any feedback via [Issues](https://github.com/eeshawn11/Running_Man/issues).

## How to Play

Move and jump to dodge cars as you run along this idyllic lake.

- W or Up to jump
- A, D, Left, Right to move
- E to pause the game
- Q to exit the game (in case a co-worker walks past)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

``` python
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eeshawn11/Running_Man.git
```

2. Check that you have PyGame installed, then launch the main.py file.

``` python
# install pygame
pip install pygame

# launch app
python main.py
```

## To-Do List

1. Include image sprites for objects
1. Include knockback and sound effect when hitting objects
1. Include more background decoration, e.g. lamp posts or trees
1. Code refactoring
1. Include list of resources in README for attribution
