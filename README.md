# Running Man (v0.3.0)

Remember those long car rides where you imagined a character running alongside the vehicle? I've recreated that experience in `PyGame`! Dodge cars and jump over obstacles as you run along a picturesque lake. See how far you can go and try to beat your high score.

> Still a work in progress. Happy to receive any feedback via [Issues](https://github.com/eeshawn11/Running_Man/issues).

## How to Play

Move and jump to dodge cars as you run along this idyllic lake.

- W or Up to jump
- A, D, Left, Right to move
- E to pause the game
- Q to exit the game (in case a co-worker walks past)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

``` python
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/eeshawn11/Running_Man.git
```

2. Check that you have PyGame installed, then launch the main.py file.

``` python
# install pygame
pip install pygame

# launch app
python main.py
```

## To-Do List

1. Include image sprites for objects
1. Add death animation
1. Add start screen and pause screen
1. Code refactoring
1. Include GIF in README
